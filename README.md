# survival-bench

A rubric-graded benchmark of survival, wilderness-medicine, and homestead
knowledge for any OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint
(OpenRouter, LM Studio, vLLM, Ollama, …).

The runtime is **stdlib-only Python** — no install needed to run the bench
itself. Dev tooling (ruff, pytest, pre-commit, poethepoet) is opt-in.

## What's in the box

Three parallel benches, each with the same rubric structure:

| File | Shape | Questions | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `bench.json` (built) | text | 45 | wilderness + homestead-medical + calibration |
| `vision_questions.json` | image | 12 | paired edible/toxic-lookalike (mushroom, plant, snake) |
| `audio_questions.json` | audio | 7 | rattlesnake, canids, alarm-calls, thunder, owl |

Each question has three rubric types:

- **`must_include`** — required correct points (+1 each)
- **`must_not_include`** — safety-critical errors (−2 each, weighted heavily)
- **`bonus`** — depth and nuance (+0.5 each)

A judge model evaluates each criterion independently as YES/NO.
Per-criterion binary judging surfaces *why* a model failed and is more
reliable than free-form scoring.

The text bench in particular weighs **calibration** heavily: ~16 of the 45
questions are designed to catch confident fabrication when context is
missing. The single most-discriminating question across model classes is
`calib_11_fake_squash` — a made-up cultivar name that nearly all models
confidently classify rather than admit they don't recognize it.

## Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sjmatta/survival-bench.git
cd survival-bench

# Configure your endpoint (OpenRouter or local)
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env — drop in OPENAI_API_KEY (and OPENAI_BASE_URL if not OpenRouter)

# Optional: dev tooling for tests + linting + pre-commit hooks
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install              # commit-time hooks (ruff, secrets, json)
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push   # pytest before push
```

If you're pointing at a local LM Studio, `OPENAI_API_KEY` can be empty:

```env
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1234/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

## Running benchmarks

The main runner is `bench.py`, with three sub-commands: `generate`, `judge`,
`report` (and `all` to chain them). Tasks are wired through
[`poethepoet`](https://poethepoet.natn.io) for convenience.

```bash
# build the unified text bench from its source files
poe build                    # → bench.json (40+ questions)

# list models exposed by the configured endpoint
poe list-models

# full text run (generate → judge → report)
poe bench-text

# vision bench
poe resolve-images           # one-time: populate image URLs from Wikipedia
poe bench-vision

# audio bench
poe resolve-audio            # one-time: download Wikimedia + xeno-canto clips
poe bench-audio
```

Without poe, run the script directly:

```bash
python bench.py generate --questions bench.json --out-dir results --resume \
  --models "qwen/qwen3.6-27b,google/gemma-4-31b-it"
python bench.py judge   --questions bench.json --out-dir results --resume \
  --judge-model "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5"
python bench.py report  --questions bench.json --out-dir results
```

Run output lives in `results*/`:

- `results*/answers/<model>.json` — raw model responses
- `results*/judgments/<model>.json` — per-criterion judge verdicts
- `results*/report.md` — final markdown report

All result directories are gitignored; you commit your bench, not your runs.

### Audio bench notes

Audio clips are CC-licensed source material from Wikimedia Commons and
xeno-canto. **They are not committed to this repo** — `poe resolve-audio`
fetches them on demand to `audio_clips/`. You'll need:

- `ffmpeg` on your `PATH` (for trimming + re-encoding)
- An [xeno-canto API key](https://xeno-canto.org/account) for the questions
  that reference `xc_id` recordings. Add `XENOCANTO_API_KEY=...` to `.env`.

The runner trims each clip to ≤20 s mono 64 kbps mp3 — keeps them under
OpenRouter's audio-input size limit and within reasonable token cost.

### Adding questions

Source files: `questions.json` (wilderness), `calibration_questions.json`,
`vision_questions.json`, `audio_questions.json`. The text bench is assembled
from `questions.json` + `calibration_questions.json` + inline homestead
additions in `build_bench.py`. Edit, then `poe build`.

Each question entry needs:

```json
{
  "id": "category_NN_short",
  "category": "...",
  "prompt": "the user-facing scenario",
  "must_include": ["criterion phrased as the model behavior expected"],
  "must_not_include": ["criterion phrased as the violation behavior to flag"],
  "bonus": ["nice-to-have detail"]
}
```

Phrase `must_not_include` as the *violation itself* ("recommend X dangerous
thing"), not as the desired safe behavior. The judge is asked whether the
violation is present in the response.

For vision questions, add `images: [{"wiki_page": "Cantharellus_cibarius"}]`;
for audio, add `audio: [{"wiki_file": "File:..."}]` or
`audio: [{"xc_id": "1077982"}]`. Then run the matching `poe resolve-*` task.

## Design choices

**Calibration over recall.** In a no-internet scenario, confident fabrication
is the dominant failure mode. The bench rewards "useful framework + honest
hedging" over both confident-wrong answers and reflexive refusal-to-engage.

**Region-invariance, mostly.** Identification is identification; once you've
correctly ID'd a death cap, the safe response doesn't change because you
crossed a state line. The bench is largely region-neutral by design;
`firstaid_03_snakebite` ("western US") is a scenario anchor, not a regional
test. The one missing-context calibration question (`calib_16_snakebite_unclear`)
tests whether the model asks for species/symptoms before branching.

**No copyrighted media in the repo.** Question files reference Wikipedia /
Wikimedia / xeno-canto sources by stable ID. Setup downloads them locally on
demand. None of the source media is redistributed here.

**Judge bias.** When the judge is one of the evaluated models, its own
answers may be over-rated. The `must_not_include` count is the most objective
signal — these are rule violations, not judgment calls. Run with two judges
and compare if you suspect bias.

## Development

```bash
poe lint          # ruff check
poe format        # ruff format
poe test          # pytest -q
poe check         # lint + tests
```

Pre-commit installs the same hooks plus a secret-scanner. `pre-push` runs
the test suite before letting you push.
